    "text": "I am a Professor in the Library and Information Science (LIS) program at Seigakuin University, Japan (2018–present). My research interests include the theories, philosophies, and ethics of LIS, as well as archival aspects of recorded information—focusing on digital preservation, social media archiving, and personal information management.\nBefore transitioning into academia, I spent 16 years (2002–2018) at the National Diet Library (NDL) of Japan, where I was involved in the planning and development of discovery search and digital archiving systems. I also oversaw a large-scale digitization project. From 2011 to 2013, I was seconded to the National Institute of Informatics (NII), where I led institutional repository initiatives."
